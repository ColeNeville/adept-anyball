## AdeptBLE Short

This version is a variation of the [short case](<https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/tree/master/44-45mm%20ball%20(%2B%20short%20version)/short>), thanks to @michaelthatsit.

This version is modified to support the [adept BLE mod](https://github.com/taichan1113/AdeptBLE). It includes room for a battery and a convenient switch hole and cover.

the battery cavity was shaped to [fit this battery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095VW1RB8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) which can be found on amazon.

The top was modified slightly to avoid pressing down on the pins soldered into the board.

the following models are meant for the adept BLE short:

- ble-bottom-short-battery: included the bottom plate and switch cover
- ble-top-short-battery: includes the slightly modified top
